# NodeJS Application Deployment with Kubernetes and GitHub Actions

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary configuration files and steps to deploy a simple NodeJS application using Kubernetes and GitHub Actions. The application exposes an API for inserting and reading key-value pairs, using Redis as the key/value storage.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:
- Docker installed locally.
- `kubectl` installed for interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Google Kubernetes Engine).
- A GitHub account for setting up GitHub Actions.

## Folder Structure
Here is what the repository structure looks like:

.
├── .github
│ └── workflows
│ └── ci.yaml
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── app.js
├── deployment.yaml
└── package.json

markdown
Copy code
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions to build the Docker image for the NodeJS application.
- `app.js`: Main file of the NodeJS application.
- `deployment.yaml`: Kubernetes manifest for deploying both the application and Redis.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`: GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD pipeline.
- `package.json`: NodeJS package configuration.

## Deployment Steps
To deploy the NodeJS application and Redis using Kubernetes, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t <image-name> .
    ```
2. **Push the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker push <image-name>
    ```
3. **Deploy to Kubernetes:**
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

## CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
The CI/CD pipeline automates the building, pushing, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions:
- **Automated Image Build and Push:** The Docker image is built and pushed to the specified container registry.
- **Deployment:** The Kubernetes manifest is applied, updating the cluster with the latest image.

## Troubleshooting
Here are a few tips if you encounter issues:
- **Check Docker and Kubernetes Permissions:** Make sure your CI/CD pipeline has appropriate permissions to interact with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Logs and Output:** Check the output logs of the GitHub Actions workflow for specific error messages.
- **Configuration Files:** Ensure all configurations in your Dockerfile and deployment.yaml are correct.
